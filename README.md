Dietary Behavior Based Food Recommender System Using Deep Learning and Clustering Techniques
By: Dr. Ammar Abdulsalam Al-Asadi

This work proposed a food recommender system, which tries to find users with similar dietary behavior and involve them in the recommendations generation process by combining clustering technique with denoising autoencoder to generate a rate prediction model. It is applied to “Food.com Recipes and Interactions” dataset. RMSE score was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model which is 0.1927. It outperformed the other models that used autoencoder and denoising autoencoder without clustering where the RMSE values are 0. 4358 and 0.4354 consequently.
